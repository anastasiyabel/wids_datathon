<b>What I Do:</b> I’m a Research Associate at the Institute for Computational Sciences at Harvard University.<br><br>
I’m a machine learning researcher focusing on health care applications. At my job, I work with clinicians to build machine learning models that have desirable properties for specific real-life downstream tasks. The model properties that I often concentrate on are: human interpretability and useful predictive uncertainties - that is, I want to build machine learning models that are right for the right reasons and who can quantify their predictive uncertainty, so that the human decision makers can rely on these models in risk-sensitive applications.<br><br>
<b>What I Love About Data Science:</b>I love that recent developments in data science is beginning to allow us to combine insights from data and domain knowledge from human experts in meaningful ways!<br><br>
<b>What Else:</b>I’ve been organizing this workshop since 2017 and I am thrilled to be doing it again this year!

<b>What I Do:</b> I am a PhD student at MIT in the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.<br><br>
As a PhD student I work on developing and applying new machine learning models for applications in biology. In particular, I’m interested in building models that capitalize on different types of data. <br><br>
<b>What Else:</b>My research focuses on developing and applying machine learning methods such as deep learning, representation learning, causal inference, and network analysis to large-scale data sets, with a special interest in biology & health.

<b>What I Do:</b>I'm a Data & Applied Scientist at Microsoft NERD Center in Cambridge.<br><br>
I am in Microsoft's AI rotation program where we work with different partner teams in Microsoft on different paradigms of AI like NLP, RL, CV, in-database ML inference. This is structured in a way that we do 4 rotations over the course of 2 years and then get placed permanently with one of the Microsoft product teams. <br><br>
<b>What I Love About Data Science:</b>I love that data science allows us to make informed decisions – and to stop guessing. I was never fond of making decisions based on gut feeling, perhaps because the gut says one thing one day, and something quite different the following day. The data ‘is what it is’, at the same time it is exciting because with better tools, comes better understanding of how we should be doing analytics and how we should use the resulting information, all of which is evolving extremely fast.<br><br>
<b>What Else:</b>I am really passionate about teaching and empowering women into this field and this the first I am organizing this workshop, really excited to be here!!

<b>What I Do:</b>I am a Software Product Manager in the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute.<br><br>
My team in the Data Sciences Platform develops tools for scientists and computational biologists to do secure cloud based research using Terra,  an open platform that connects researchers, datasets and tools into one location. We have enabled tools like RStudio, Jupyter notebooks and Galaxy to promote scientific breakthroughs faster and more efficiently. <br><br>
<b>What I Love About Data Science:</b>As a mathematician and population genetics researcher by training, I love how data science enables us to make sense of large scale ecosystems. I also love how data science gives clarity to previously obtuse and unknown situations leading us to a more informed world. <br><br>
<b>What Else:</b>It is an honor to be a part of WiDS and I can’t wait to get to know some, if not all the participants a little bit more!
