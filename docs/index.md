This year's workshop is organized by:
1. Weiwei Pan (Harvard IACS)
2. Karren Dai Yang (MIT IDSS)

### What will you do at the workshop?
The WiDS  Datathon workshop consists of a data science/machine learning tutorial followed by a team-based practical session focused on a single data science task. In this workshop:
1.  you will be introduced to data science/machine learning concepts and methods (especially relevant to the WiDS Datathon Challenge)
2.  you will be able to form teams during the workshop and get hands-on experience implementing machine learning models and working with the WiDS Datathon dataset 
3.  you will receive mentoring from data scientists and machine learning researchers from universities and tech companies in the Boston area.

### Who should sign up for the workshop?
We invite all participants with a strong interest in data science! 

Programming experience as well as some previous training in probability, statistics and mathematics is helpful. But we welcome participants from all backgrounds!

### Where is the workshop located?

The workshop will be held at:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*1 Memorial Drive*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Floor M*<br>
