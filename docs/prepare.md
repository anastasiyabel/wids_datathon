# Preparing for the Workshop

## About the WiDS 2021 Datathon
This year, participants will work again with the WiDS 2020 Datathon data from MITâ€™s [GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score)](https://gossis.mit.edu) dataset. Last year, the challenge was to predict patient survival; this year. the WiDS Datathon will focus on creating classifiers to determine whether patients have a type of diabetes which could potentially inform later treatment in the ICU.

The [WiDS Datathon](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021) is hosted on Kaggle, an online community of data scientists.
